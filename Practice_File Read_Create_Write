'''
-Write a Python program that reads the contents of a text file called "input.txt," 
removes duplicate lines, and writes the unique lines to a new file called "output.txt." 
Consider lines to be duplicates if they have the same content, regardless of leading or trailing whitespace. (use context manager)

-For example, if "input.txt" contains: 'Hello, World! Python is fun. Python is fun. Python is fun.'
After running the program, "output.txt" should contain:'Hello, World! Python is fun.'

-Handle errors properly.
