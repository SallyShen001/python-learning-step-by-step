"""
Given a String s, reverse the individual words (don't change the order of words). Words are separated by space.
Do not use methods from string class (str), use loops, lists, operators etc.

Your Task: Complete the function reverseWords() which takes string s as input and returns a string containing the words 
in reversed order. Each word in the returning string should also be separated by space

Example:
Input: s = "i like this program very much"
Output: "i ekil siht margorp yrev hcum"
