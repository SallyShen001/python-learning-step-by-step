'''
1. We have the function `a` which was returned by the `startAt(1)` call. This means that `a` is a function that has `x` set to 1.
2. When we call `a(1)`, we are invoking the function `a` and passing the value 1 as the argument to the `incrementBy` function.
3. Inside the `incrementBy` function, the parameter `y` will take the value of the argument we passed, which is 1.
4. The `incrementBy` function then returns the sum of `x` (which is 1) and `y` (which is 1), resulting in a return value of 2.
5. The second `print` statement then prints the result, which is 2.
